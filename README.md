# YouGraph Project

Social networks are already part of people's daily lives. Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, among others, allow the interaction, communication, and socialization of millions of people daily (AGGRAWAL et al., 2018). Currently, one of the most successful social networks is Youtube with more than 2 billion hours watched daily (YOUTUBE, 2020). Thus, the use of information retrieval and extraction techniques has great value in the most diverse applications, such as recommendation systems, content categorization systems, Q&A systems (questioning answering), and others. In addition, the processing of the contents spoken in the videos as well as the analysis of their metadata (such as the number of likes, dislikes, and comments), have great value in decision making by marketing and administration professionals.

In this way, this repository aims to offer all the necessary tools for the public interested in working with this type of data. Thus, scripts for solving the following NLP problems are present in this project:

* extraction of audio transcripts from Youtube and other metadata;
* segmentation of sentences;
* topic modeling (LDA);
* generation of vector representations (Word2Vec, Bert, TF-IDF)
* fact extraction (OpenIE);
* refinement of knowledge tuples;
* extraction of named entities (NERs);
