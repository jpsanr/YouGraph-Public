# YouGraph Project

Social networks are already part of people's daily lives. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, among others, allow the interaction, communication and socialization of millions of people daily. Currently, one of the most successful social networks is Youtube with over 2 billion hours watched daily. Given the dimensions of this platform, it is natural to understand that YouTube has become an essential part of companies' digital marketing strategies, with massive investments being made. Given this context, we propose the development of a method capable of acquiring knowledge from the audio transcripts of Youtube videos, together with their meta-data (title, description, number of views, ...). All knowledge learned will be represented in the form of a knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs are an interesting structure for the representation of knowledge, as they allow the representation of knowledge from concepts and entities. Several applications could benefit from these implementations, among which we can mention information curation systems, question and answering system (Q\&A) systems, search engines, among others.
In this context, the method presented in this work could also serve as an important management tool in marketing for trend detection, viral detection in videos, analysis of synergy between brands in digital influencers, and other applications.

In this way, this repository aims to offer all the necessary tools for the public interested in working with this type of data. Thus, scripts for solving the following NLP problems are present in this project:

* extraction of audio transcripts from Youtube and other metadata;
* segmentation of sentences;
* topic modeling (LDA);
* generation of vector representations (Word2Vec, Bert, TF-IDF)
* fact extraction (OpenIE);
* refinement of knowledge tuples;
* extraction of named entities (NERs);
